# Interview Example Project

As a portion of a recent interview process, I was asked to complete several tickets and demonstrate the end-to-end skills needed for the role. Always on the lookout for optimizing my use of resources, I have done so in a reusable repository.

## Background

The organization prompting this sample project runs the TALL stack, with some Laravel Nova and Filament added as major portions of their tooling. During the interview I established that the team did not take up a practice of using static analysis, a tool I find indespensible, and had some TDD practices but wanted to go further.

I did timebox this project to three hours, with execution time being just about 3 hours and 8 minutes. There were two steps that I did not capture timing for on this project, I am estimating an additional 15 minutes for those steps. Total time would be approximately 3 hours and 23 minutes.

I picked approaches that appeared to be new or underused patterns in order to spark conversation. For example, I leveraged the Spatie Data package instead of a simple class.

## How to grok this project

There are six issues on this repository, each with a seperate PR resolving the needs documented. The PR's are inteded to be handled in numeric order, lowest to highest. I would suggest starting with the first PR and reading the comments, code and commits before moving to higher numbered PR's.
