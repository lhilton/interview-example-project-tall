# Affiliate.com Interview Project

## About this project

This project is to setup a website using Laravel with a starter kit and to implement features for the website. The features will be defined in GitHub Issues.

The goal of this project is to help Affiliate.com understand how you would approach working in a remote environment as part of our team. We value clear and consise communication in GitHub. Code should be functional, documented, and follow framework best practices.

## AI Tools

We know tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT exist and we leverage these tools. For this project we ask that the code submitted be your own original work so we can learn how you think.


## Setup Local Environment

You'll need to have a local develpoment area to work on this project.
Please use [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/sail) as your environment. 
 
- Laravel 11
- Jetstream
- TALL stack
- Tailwind
- Database (Ex: MySql)
- Web server (Ex: nginx)

## Project Guidelines

We use a ["One issue, One branch, one PR"](https://dev.to/victoria/git-branching-for-small-teams-2n64) approach.

For each GitHub Issue create a branch using the convention for branch name:

`[Issue #]-[one or two descriptive words]`

Example for issue #10:  `10-fix-login`

Create a Pull Request for each branch and name it something descriptive.

In the body of the PR add the following:

- Title example: "[#10] Fix Login"
- Text "For #[Issue#]" to link the PR to the GitHub issue.
- A `# Description` area describing what the code does.
- A `# Steps to test` area with notes on how the reviewer can test the code.
- Assign @kingsloi, @yang-he, @freddy-chan, @daminute as PR reviewers.

You will probably create new PRs before earlier ones are reviewed/merged, so 
you can fork from your first issue into branch for issue 2 and when you create the PR just set it to merge to the first branch.  If this is confusing let us know.
